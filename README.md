## Hello ! 👋
I'm Jules Poulain, aka Bigaston. For now I study game development at [CNAM-ENJMIN](https://enjminbundle.itch.io/).

### Projects 🪚
On the past I've worked on:
- ☀️ [SolisVi](https://bigaston.itch.io/solisvi): Solis Vi take place in an utopian and fantasied future where the SolarPunk movement really exist. It's a virtual reality game where you have to fix all the problems after a violent storm.
- 🔴 [YouPod](https://youpod.io) (now part of [podCloud](https://podcloud.fr)): Convert all your podcast episodes into Video for YouTube, Mastodon, Instagram, for free!

I've also work on differents GameJam and small projects, all available on [poulain.dev/projects](https://poulain.dev/projects)

### Skills 🧠
My main center of skills is Web Environment with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Svelte, Electron.  
But I've also worked on video games, with **Unity (🪦)**, **Godot**, Unreal Engine, Love2D, PICO-8, PlayDate, PixiJS... I like to adapt on the technology I'm working on!  
I've also some DevOps skills, with Servers Management, Docker, Github Actions...

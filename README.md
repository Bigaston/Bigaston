On the past I've worked on:
- ☀️ [Solis Vi](https://bigaston.itch.io/solisvi): Solis Vi take place in an utopian and fantasied future where the SolarPunk movement really exist. It's a virtual reality game where you have to fix all the problems after a violent storm.
- 🔴 [YouPod](https://youpod.io) (now part of [podCloud](https://podcloud.fr)): Convert all your podcast episodes into Video for YouTube, Mastodon, Instagram, for free!

Now my current projets are:
- 🚁 [FunPV](https://bigaston.me/funpv): FunPV is a small FPV Drone Simulator focused on fun, quests and narrations.
- 🤖 Suburbia Electronica: School Project with a small robot exploring american suburbs to find happyness!

I've also work on differents GameJam and small projects, all available on [bigaston.itch.io](https://bigaston.itch.io) and I'm part of [ilve.games](https://ilve.games)
